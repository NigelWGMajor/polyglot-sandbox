    "# Testing using a vscode project interactively in a notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to be able to use a notebook to access classes under development in a VSCode project, the intent being to interactively test the code and also debug the code in VSCode.  The Notebook version can be used to document, demo and test the code, while the VS code environment can be used to edit the contributing files and make adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the cs files have namespaces, which the notebooks do not support. Accordingly, the project file should have an entry like\n",
    "`<RootNamespace>Nix.Library.JsonSql</RootNamespace>`. While checkinbg that, you can identify any packages tha need to be loaded too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected Steps are\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a project in VSCode\n",
    "2. Create a notebook page\n",
    "3. Import any dependant packages (refer to the (usings)\n",
