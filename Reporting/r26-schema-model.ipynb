    "Most of the qualifications (identity, filter, sorter, special handling, parameter) occur at the column level\n",
    "The main exception to this is explicit and implied keys, which are directional links between two columns.\n",

    "\n",
    "Similarly, parameter candidates could identify 1-n occurrences with an index list ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplest structure would repeat schema/table names in a simple list of columns with attributes. A variation could use a lookup list for the schema and table names but hide the details... also, although fk -> pk relationships are n -> 1, the ns are each associated with single column, so if the traversable link ios stored at the site of the foreign reference it is effectively 1->1\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, we think of Schema as being navigated like\n",

    "  Property Value --> Column --> Table --> Schema --> Links  --> Link Columns --> Link Table --> Link Schema\n",

    "This is clearly more efficient and readily Json-serialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "The links would identify the PK and (implied or explicit) FK Schema.Column.Table. \n",
    "Seeing as the Column data is really just a long list, we could add the refs to the FK column, as each really points to one PK: this would require us to identify and have a PK reference for all such candidates... We might need to identify these as Parameters to simplify references...\n",
    "\n",
    "How we handle this depends on whether there is a meaningful behavioral difference between how we handle FKs that point to a PK (N --> 1) or implied references that might connect outside of the realm (e.g. user ids, org ids, external references to other scopes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly outside references that do not exist as PKs in the system-under-analysis need to be parameters! So user keys, org ids etc.\n",
    "These would typically be injected by the user or perhaps a microservice call. So good.\n",
